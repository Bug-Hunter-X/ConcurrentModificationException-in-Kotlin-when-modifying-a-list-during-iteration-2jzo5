This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin involving ConcurrentModificationException.  The `bug.kt` file shows code that throws this exception when trying to modify a list while iterating. The solution, presented in `bugSolution.kt`, uses the `removeIf` function or an iterator for safe modification.  This is crucial to understand for avoiding unexpected runtime crashes in Kotlin.
